Marbury v. Madison was a landmark Supreme Court case decided in 1803. The case established the principle of judicial review, which gives the Supreme Court the power to strike down laws that it finds to be unconstitutional.
The case involved William Marbury, who had been appointed as a justice of the peace by President John Adams in the final days of his presidency. Adams's secretary of state, John Marshall, who would later become the chief justice of the Supreme Court, had signed Marbury's commission but had not delivered it before Adams left office.
When Thomas Jefferson became president, he refused to deliver Marbury's commission. Marbury sued Madison, Jefferson's secretary of state, seeking a writ of mandamus, which is a court order requiring a government official to perform a specific duty.
The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Marbury, finding that he had a legal right to his commission. However, the Court also ruled that it could not issue a writ of mandamus to Madison because the Judiciary Act of 1789, which authorized the Court to issue such writs, was unconstitutional.
In his opinion for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall reasoned that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and that all other laws must be consistent with it. He also reasoned that the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the Constitution and to strike down laws that it finds to be unconstitutional.
The principle of judicial review established in Marbury v. Madison is one of the most important principles in American constitutional law. It gives the Supreme Court the power to check the actions of the other branches of government and to ensure that all laws are consistent with the Constitution.
Marbury v. Madison is a landmark case because it established the principle of judicial review, which is one of the cornerstones of American constitutional law. It also affirmed the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate arbiter of the Constitution. The case has been cited in thousands of subsequent cases, and it continues to be relevant today.
