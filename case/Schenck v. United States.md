Clear and present danger is a legal standard that is used to determine whether the government can restrict speech that is protected by the First Amendment. The standard was first articulated by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in the case of Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919).
In Schenck, the defendant was convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 by distributing leaflets that urged resistance to the draft during World War I. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, holding that the government could restrict speech that created a "clear and present danger" of causing a "serious substantive evil" that the government had a right to prevent.
The clear and present danger standard is a very high standard to meet. In order to restrict speech, the government must show that the speech is likely to cause an immediate and serious harm. The standard is designed to protect freedom of speech, even when the speech is controversial or unpopular.
The clear and present danger standard has been used to strike down a number of government restrictions on speech, including laws that prohibited the advocacy of violence, the distribution of obscene materials, and the burning of the American flag.
Here are some examples of speech that have been held to not create a clear and present danger:
Criticizing the government
Advocating for unpopular political views
Expressing religious beliefs
Engaging in symbolic protests
In general, the Supreme Court has been reluctant to restrict speech under the clear and present danger standard. The Court has recognized that the First Amendment protects a wide range of speech, even speech that is offensive or harmful.
The clear and present danger standard is an important safeguard for freedom of speech. It ensures that the government cannot restrict speech simply because it is controversial or unpopular.
