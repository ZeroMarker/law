United States v. Wong Kim Ark was a landmark Supreme Court case decided in 1898. The case established the principle that all children born in the United States are citizens, regardless of the citizenship status of their parents.
The case involved Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese parents. Wong's parents were both Chinese citizens, but they had permanent residency in the United States. When Wong was 21 years old, he returned to China to visit his parents. When he tried to return to the United States, he was denied entry on the ground that he was not a citizen.
Wong sued the government, arguing that he was a citizen because he was born in the United States. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Wong, finding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grants citizenship to all children born in the United States, regardless of the citizenship status of their parents.
The Supreme Court's decision in Wong Kim Ark was a major victory for civil rights and for the principle of birthright citizenship. The decision has been cited in many subsequent cases, and it remains the law of the land today.
Wong Kim Ark's case is a reminder that all people born in the United States are citizens, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin. Birthright citizenship is one of the most fundamental rights in American democracy, and it is a right that should be protected for all Americans.
