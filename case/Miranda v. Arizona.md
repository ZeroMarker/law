The Miranda warning is a type of notification customarily given by police to criminal suspects in police custody (or in a custodial interrogation) advising them of their right to silence and, in effect, protection from self-incrimination; that is, their right to refuse to answer questions or provide information to law enforcement or other officials. Named for the U.S. Supreme Court's 1966 decision Miranda v. Arizona, these rights are often referred to as Miranda rights.
The Miranda warning is part of a preventive criminal procedure rule that law enforcement are required to administer to protect an individual who is in custody and subject to direct questioning or its functional equivalent from a violation of their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. In Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court held that the admission of an elicited incriminating statement by a suspect not informed of these rights violates the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, through the incorporation of these rights into state law.
The Miranda warning is typically given in the following format:
"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. Do you understand these rights? With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me?"
The Miranda warning must be given before any custodial interrogation begins. A custodial interrogation is defined as any questioning that occurs after a person has been arrested or otherwise deprived of their freedom in a significant way.
If a suspect is not given the Miranda warning before being interrogated, any incriminating statements they make may not be admissible in court. This is because the Fifth Amendment protects people from being forced to incriminate themselves.
There are some exceptions to the Miranda rule. For example, the police do not need to give the Miranda warning if they are asking the suspect for their name, address, or date of birth. The police also do not need to give the Miranda warning if they are questioning the suspect about a crime that is not a felony.
If you are ever arrested and questioned by the police, it is important to remember your Miranda rights. You have the right to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning. If you are unsure of your rights, you should ask the police to stop questioning you until you have had a chance to speak to an attorney.
