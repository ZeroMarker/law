The eggshell skull rule, also known as the thin skull rule, is a legal doctrine that states that a tortfeasor is liable for the full extent of the injuries caused to their victim, even if the victim is more susceptible to injury than a normal person. This means that the tortfeasor cannot escape liability by arguing that the victim's injuries were more severe than would have been expected for a normal person.
The eggshell skull rule is based on the principle that the tortfeasor takes their victim as they find them. In other words, the tortfeasor is responsible for all of the consequences of their actions, even if those consequences are more severe than would have been expected for a normal person.
The eggshell skull rule was first articulated in the case of Vosburg v. Putney, 86 Wis. 27 (1893). In that case, the defendant negligently struck the plaintiff in the head with a rock. The plaintiff suffered a concussion, which led to a latent mental condition. The plaintiff's mental condition eventually became so severe that he was unable to work.
The defendant argued that he was not liable for the plaintiff's mental condition because it was a result of the plaintiff's latent mental condition. The court rejected this argument and held that the defendant was liable for the full extent of the plaintiff's injuries, even though those injuries were more severe than would have been expected for a normal person.
The eggshell skull rule has been applied in a variety of cases, including cases involving physical injuries, emotional injuries, and economic losses. For example, the eggshell skull rule has been applied in cases where the victim has suffered a pre-existing medical condition that was aggravated by the defendant's negligence.
The eggshell skull rule is an important legal doctrine that protects victims of negligence. It ensures that victims are compensated for the full extent of their injuries, even if those injuries are more severe than would have been expected for a normal person.
